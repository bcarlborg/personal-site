                <h2 id="1-pushdown-automata-and-their-variants">1: Pushdown Automata and their Variants</h2>
                <p>Pushdown automata (PDAs for short) are a specific model of automata.</p>
                <p>Automata are abstract models of computers; they are theoretical
                    machines defined using mathematical concepts. Automata can help us
                    model programs and software in the same way that calculus can help
                    us model a ball&#39;s path through the air. Studying automata can help
                    us conceptualize the programs and algorithms we work with on a
                    regular basis.</p>
                <p>Automata can take many forms, but we often discuss
                    string-recognizing automata. A specific automaton can be imagined as
                    a machine that processes a sequence of characters. Once all of the
                    characters are processed, the automaton either accepts or denies the
                    string. This simple form of machine proves to be a surprisingly
                    useful abstraction for most software.</p>
                <p>There are many different forms of string-recognizing automata, each
                    with varying capabilities and power. Often, the key distinction
                    between different forms of automata is the memory that the automata
                    can utilize. The simplest automata, like finite state machines, may
                    have only one memory cell whose value is determined by following a
                    graph structure of states based on the input characters read by the
                    automata. Other more powerful automata like Turing machines have an
                    infinitely large memory that can be filled with any number of
                    predefined symbols. Pushdown automata are one type of automata that
                    sits somewhere in the middle of the total hierarchy of automata.</p>
                <p>A PDA has one memory cell controlled with a finite state control
                    graph as well as an infinite memory store structured as a stack.,
                    where elements can only be read from or written to the top of the
                    stack. Their infinite memory gives them more power than the simpler
                    automata like finite automata, but the restricted form of the stack
                    memory makes them less capable than an automata like a Turing
                    machine.</p>
                <p>PDAs are appropriate models for a surprising number of practical
                    computational tasks. PDA&#39;s can model programs straddling the line
                    dividing easy and hard problems. A program that can be modeled by a
                    PDA can often be solved quite efficiently, but a problem too
                    difficult to be solved with a pushdown automata may be difficult to
                    solve in a reasonable time frame. Many computational problems of
                    practical importance, like parsing a programming language or a depth
                    first search of a tree, can be modeled with a pushdown automata.</p>
                <p>PDAs are often given at least a chapter&#39;s worth of focus in books
                    covering theoretical computer science. A typical coverage of PDAs
                    will introduce a definition of nondeterministic pushdown automata,
                    give a few example PDAs, provide a proof of equivalence with
                    context-free grammars, and maybe introduce deterministic pushdown
                    automata.</p>
                <p>I have struggled with the coverage of pushdown automata in a number
                    of resources because I failed to fully grasp the initial definition
                    that the content builds on. I have two theories about why these
                    definitions were difficult to wrap my head around.</p>
                <p>Firstly, there are a handful of different PDA definitions in use
                    across different books on the subject. While all of these
                    definitions are quite similar and define variants that are
                    computationally equivalent, the variety can be disorienting. The
                    definitions all yield slightly different pushdown automata variants
                    with their own subtleties. It took me longer than I would like to
                    admit to realize that these different variants were in use. It took
                    me even longer to internalize the difference in the definitions and
                    feel comfortable switching between them.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I feel that pushdown automata are simply peculiar. PDAs
                    have neither the austere simplicity of a finite state machine nor
                    the all encompassing flexibility of a Turing machine. Instead, they
                    are an automata with an awkward stack memory structure that is
                    tricky to define using a mathematical definition. Defining PDAs
                    often involves additions to our definitions like starting stack
                    symbols that just feel awkward.</p>
                <p>It is because of my trouble with these definitions that I wanted to
                    write this post. Over time I was able to develop my own mental model
                    for organizing and thinking about these definitions that helped me
                    build a conceptual foundation for PDAs and begin to understand the
                    more interesting results about this automata.</p>
                <h2 id="2-components-of-a-pda-definition">2: Components of a PDA Definition</h2>
                <p>It is worth re-emphasizing that PDAs are only a theoretical model of
                    computation. As such, it is entirely up to us to define what they
                    are and how they work using tools from mathematics. The most common
                    definitions of pushdown automata use sets of symbols and functions
                    over those sets as the building blocks of a PDA definition.</p>
                <p>A typical automata definition may look something like this:
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mtext>(Q, Σ, Γ, δ,&#xA0;</mtext>
                        <msub>
                            <mi>q</mi>
                            <mn>0</mn>
                        </msub>
                        <mi>,&#xA0;</mi>
                        <msub>
                            <mi>Z</mi>
                            <mn>0</mn>
                        </msub>
                        <mi>,&#xA0;</mi>
                        <msub>
                            <mi>Q</mi>
                            <mn>F</mn>
                        </msub>
                        <mi>)</mi>
                    </math>
                    . This definition is a collection of 7 symbols (a 7-tuple) where
                    each symbol represent some set, function.
                </p>
                <p>At first encounter, it may not even seem possible that a series of
                    symbols representing sets and functions can define an abstract
                    computer. It is not a particularly intuitive representation.</p>
                <p>To understand a definition like this, I find it productive to think
                    about the broad types of information that need to be formalized,
                    then figure out how the symbols fit into those categories.</p>
                <p>Our automata is akin to a program on a computer in more than just an
                    abstract sense. I find that using a similar mental model for
                    specifying programs is useful for specifying an automata.</p>
                <p>When we consider a program, we need to know about the program&#39;s:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Program Character Sets:</strong>
                        What symbols are used to represent the program, and how are they
                        encoded. Is the program a sequence of unicode characters? Or a
                        binary blob composed of 16-bit machine code instructions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Program Static Data or Initial Configurations:</strong>
                        Programs are not just code. They include static data with
                        information like the default values for variables and constants
                        all need to be specified in the program data itself.</li>
                    <li><strong>Program Code:</strong>
                        The actual instruction that the program executes. These
                        instructions define the program&#39;s behavior and control flow.</li>
                    <li><strong>Program Accepting or Terminating Conditions:</strong>
                        When is the program done, and how do we interpret its results,
                        does the program write a certain value to the stdout, does it set
                        some register to indicate it was successful? We need a way to
                        interpret the output of our program and determine wether it was
                        successful or unsuccessful.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We can apply this same mental model of a program&#39;s content to the
                    definition of a pushdown automata. The information in our PDA
                    definition or specification needs to explain:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Automata Character Sets:</strong>
                        As mentioned before, a PDA processes an input string and writes
                        and reads data from an internal stack. Our input tape and our
                        stack are both collections of symbols and we must specify all of
                        the characters that our automata is equipped to process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automata Programming:</strong>
                        As our automata executes, it will read input characters, it will
                        update its state, and it will push and pop symbols on our stack.
                        This behavior can be encoded using a function that describes how
                        the automata updates its internal state as new characters are
                        processed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automata Initial Configuration:</strong>
                        Just like a program, our PDA also may have some initial
                        configuration or default values. PDAs specify an initial control
                        state and may have some initial data on their stack in order to
                        kick off their execution properly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automata Accepting Conditions:</strong>
                        Finally, we need to specify the conditions that indicate our PDA
                        has accepted a string. These conditions will be based on some
                        aspect of the pushdown automata&#39;s internal data (finite control
                        and the stack).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Every symbol in our definition helps to specify one of the above
                    aspects of our program. Understanding the formal definitions of
                    pushdown automata is a matter of internalizing how each symbol and
                    its value informs one of the above qualities in our definition.</p>
                <p>To make things more concrete, we will explain a few common PDA
                    definition variants and show how each fits into this little
                    framework.</p>
                <h2 id="3-single-character-popping-pdas">3: Single Character Popping PDAs</h2>
                <p>The first PDA variant we will discuss is one that pops a single
                    character off the stack on every transition. This is a common PDA
                    variant introduced in CS theory and is often the base that other PDA
                    variants are based on. We will build up a definition for this PDA
                    using the framework above.</p>
                <p>We first begin with the simplest category, character sets. We need
                    to introduce two sets of symbols this PDA can process. One set for
                    the input string and another for the stack.</p>
                <p><strong>Character sets:</strong>
                    Our PDA uses two character sets,
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mtext>Σ</mtext>
                    </math>
                    and
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mtext>Γ</mtext>
                    </math>
                    . These refer to the set of input symbols the automata is capable of
                    working with.
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mtext>Σ</mtext>
                    </math>
                    is the set of symbols the automata can read in the input strings,
                    and
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mtext>Γ</mtext>
                    </math>
                    is the set of symbols that the automata can read and write from its
                    stack.
                </p>
                <p>Now that we have established the symbols this PDA will use, we can
                    formalize the single popping behavior of this pushdown automata.
                    This quality will be captured by the programming in our framework
                    above. As with any PDA&#39;s programming, we need to define a finite set
                    of control states for the automata and a transition function that
                    outlines how the automaton moves from one state to another as a
                    result of the current input and stack character. The states will be
                    a simple set, and the transition function will read an input
                    character, read a finite control state, and pop a character off of
                    the top of the stack, then output possible next states and new data
                    to add to the stack.</p>
                <p><strong>Programming:</strong>
                    Our set of finite states will be represented by the symbol
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mtext>Q</mtext>
                    </math>
                    , and our transition function will be represented by the symbol
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mtext>δ</mtext>

                    is a transition function of the form
                    <math>
                        <mi>δ: Q x { Σ ∪ ɛ } x Γ → P(Q x Γ*)</mi>
                    </math>
                    . This can be read as saying the transition function
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mtext>δ</mtext>
                    </math>
                    takes three inputs: a required current state, an optional current
                    input character, and a required symbol at the top of the stack. The
                    function&#39;s output is a set of state and stack symbol string pairs.
                </p>
                <p>There is a peculiar aspect to this transition function worth
                    highlighting. On every transition, we must pop one character from
                    the stack, but we may push zero or many characters back on. To me,
                    this seemed an unsightly asymmetry at first; however, it is
                    necessary in order to grow and reduce the stack. When we wish to
                    reduce the stack size, we may pop a character and push an empty
                    string. When we wish to grow the stack, we may pop a character, then
                    push a string with that same character and additional new stack
                    characters appended on.</p>
                <p>With the programming and character sets established, we can now
                    consider the PDA&#39;s initial configuration. In order to support single
                    character popping on every transition, we must add a starting stack
                    character to our initial configuration. Every transition our PDA
                    makes requires there already be one character to pop, and so, in
                    order for our first transition to function, we must already have one
                    character on the stack.</p>
                <p><strong>Initial Configuration:</strong>
                    Our initial configuration must include two values. Like any finite
                    state machine, we must include a starting state
                    <math display="inline">
                        <msub>
                            <mi>q</mi>
                            <mn>0</mn>
                        </msub>
                    </math>
                    where
                    <math display="inline">
                        <msub>
                            <mi>q</mi>
                            <mn>0</mn>
                        </msub>
                        <mtext>∊ Q</mtext>
                    </math>
                    . As mentioned above, for this particular pushdown automata variant,
                    we also must include a starting stack symbol
                    <math display="inline">
                        <msub>
                            <mi>Z</mi>
                            <mn>0</mn>
                        </msub>
                    </math>
                    where
                    <math display="inline">
                        <msub>
                            <mi>Z</mi>
                            <mn>0</mn>

                        <mtext>∊ Γ</mtext>
                    </math>
                </p>


                <p>Finally, we must specify the acceptance conditions for this PDA.
                    Much like finite automata, this PDA uses a set of accepting states,
                    which are a subset of the states introduced in the programming of
                    this automata.</p>
                <p><strong>Accepting Conditions:</strong>
                    finally, we must specify the acceptance conditions for this PDA.
                    Much like finite automata, this PDA uses a set of accepting state
                    conditions
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mtext>F</mtext>
                    </math>
                    where
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mtext>F ⊆ Q</mtext>
                    </math>
                    . If the PDA is one of these states when the full input has been
                    read, then the PDA accepts the current string.
                </p>
                <p>We can put all of these values together into a 7 component tuple .
                    Any base PDA that we define will need to specify values for these 7
                    properties.</p>
                <math display="inline">
                    <mtext>(Q, Σ, Γ, δ,&#xA0;</mtext>
                    <msub>
                        <mi>q</mi>
                        <mn>0</mn>

                    <msub>
                        <mi>Q</mi>

                </math>

                <p>By thinking about this automata definition using a mental framework
                    in which automata are like programs and must specify character sets,
                    initial configurations, programming, and acceptance conditions, it
                    becomes much easier to break down a definition like this. Instead of
                    seeing an arbitrary list of symbols, we can see that each symbol
                    helps build out a core aspect of our automata&#39;s behavior.</p>
                <h2 id="4-multi-character-popping-pdas">4: Multi-Character Popping PDAs</h2>
                <p>Another common form of PDA definition is one in which the PDA has
                    the ability to pop zero or many characters on each transition step.
                    This is a natural extension from the base PDA and can make the
                    programming of the PDA much simpler. This variant&#39;s definition is
                    nearly identical to the base single character popping PDA&#39;s but with
                    two slight modifications, one in its the programming and another in
                    its initial configuration.</p>
                <p>With regard to programming, this PDA will use the same set of finite
                    control states but will need a slightly updated transition function
                    to support popping multiple characters. This is a relatively easy
                    update and merely requires updating the typing of our transition
                    function. We simply need to accept
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mi>Γ*</mi>
                    </math>
                    as an input rather than
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mi>Γ</mi>
                    </math>
                    .
                </p>
                <p><strong>Programming:</strong>
                    Our PDA will have a set of states,
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mtext>Q</mtext>
                    </math>
                    , for its finite state control. The transition function for this PDA
                    will be represented by the symbol
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mtext>δ</mtext>
                    </math>
                    which is a function with the form
                    <math>
                        <mi>δ: Q x { Σ ∪ ɛ } x Γ* → P(Q x Γ*)</mi>
                    </math>
                    . This can be read as saying the transition function
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mtext>δ</mtext>
                    </math>
                    takes three inputs: a required current state, an optional current
                    input character, and a string of zero or many stack symbols from the
                    top of the stack. The function&#39;s output is a set of state and stack
                    symbol string pairs.
                </p>
                <p>The other difference in the multi-popping PDA&#39;s definition is in the
                    initial configuration this PDA needs. In the base PDA we needed to
                    add a start symbol to our stack so that our transition function
                    could make a valid first move. But with this PDA, that is no longer
                    necessary. We can have transitions that pop no characters from our
                    stack, and so starting with an empty stack is ok. With this, our new
                    initial configuration is simplified:</p>
                <p><strong>Initial Configuration:</strong>
                    This PDA variant will require a starting finite control state
                    represented by the symbol
                    <math display="inline">
                        <msub>
                            <mi>q</mi>
                            <mn>0</mn>
                        </msub>
                    </math>
                    where
                    <math display="inline">
                        <msub>
                            <mi>q</mi>
                            <mn>0</mn>
                        </msub>
                        <mtext>∊ Q</mtext>
                    </math>
                    . This PDA variant will not require a starting stack symbol as our
                    first PDA variant did.
                </p>
                <p>We can put this updated programming and initial state together with
                    the unchanged character sets and accepting conditions from the
                    previous automata definition and form the following definition:</p>
                <p>Our multi-character popping PDA is defined by the following 6-tuple
                    <math display="inline">
                        <mtext>(Q, Σ, Γ, δ,&#xA0;</mtext>
                        <msub>
                            <mi>q</mi>
                            <mn>0</mn>
                        </msub>
                        <mi>,&#xA0;</mi>
                        <msub>

                    </math>
                </p>
                <p>The differences between this and the base PDA definition are small
                    -- a slight change to our transition function and the removal of a
                    state symbol -- but by using a mental model where PDAs are built
                    from character sets, initial state, programming, and accepting
                    states, the significance of the differences are more easily
                    understood.</p>
                <h2 id="5-stack-state-accepting-pdas">5: Stack State Accepting PDAs</h2>
                <p>The final PDA variant I will introduce is one that uses an alternate
                    acceptance mechanism. Our base PDA and multi-character popping PDA
                    both accept strings using predetermined accepting states (We&#39;ve been
                    using the symbol
                    <math display="inline">
                        <msub>
                            <mi>Q</mi>
                            <mn>F</mn>

                    </math>
                    to represent these). This acceptance method is the same as one that
                    would be used by a finite automaton to accept a string.
                </p>
                <p>But, just like we can modify the programming of a PDA to create a
                    new variant, we can also modify the acceptance conditions of our
                    PDA. We can create a new PDA that accepts when the stack is in a
                    particular configuration. We can specify a string that needs to be
                    on the stack when the input string has been fully read. If that
                    string is on the stack, then we will accept it.</p>
                <p><strong>Acceptance Conditions:</strong>
                    We will specify the string that must be on the stack to accept using
                    the symbol

                    .
                </p>
                <p>We can apply this acceptance modification to both of the PDAs we
                    have defined thus far by replacing the final state symbol
                    <math display="inline">

                    with our new stack acceptance string symbol
                    <math display="inline">
                        <msub>

                <p>For the single popping PDA, a stack state acceptance variant would
                    be defined with the following 7-tuple:</p>

                <p>For the multi-character popping PDA, a stack state acceptance
                    variant would be defined with the following 7-tuple:</p>
                <math display="inline">
                    <mtext>(Q, Σ, Γ, δ,&#xA0;</mtext>

                <p>It is worth noting that many textbooks and resources which cover
                    PDAs present an empty state acceptance PDA. This is merely a sub
                    case of the stack state acceptance PDA in which the accepting PDA
                    string is just the empty string. Definitions for this specific PDA
                    variant will omit

                <p><strong>Why choose one definition over the other?</strong></p>
                <p>Ultimately it comes down to your goals for using the PDA. Some
                    variants are better for representing certain proofs while others are
                    easier to write programs for. Choosing one variant over another is not
                    that different from choosing one programming language over the other.
                    Usually, each language can achieve the same end results, but it comes
                    down to how well-suited that language is for the task.</p>
                <p><strong>Are these variants truly interchangeable?</strong></p>
                <p>Computationally, yes, these are interchangeable. This means that each
                    of the PDA variants presented here can accept every language that
                    another PDA variant would. In terms of complexity, the situation is a
                    bit more complicated. Some of the machines can represent an automata
                    for the same language with different complexity properties.</p>
                <p>The different complexity properties of each PDA are particularly
                    obvious with the multi-character popping PDA. It is clear that the
                    single character popping PDA can achieve the same results by simply
                    popping the letters of multi-character string one by one. But doing so
                    requires more steps and more states than the multi-character PDA would
                    use.</p>
                <p><strong>How could we prove they are equivalent?</strong></p>
                <p>The process of proving that two automata variants are equivalent comes
                    down to showing that any language that can be accepted by an automaton
                    in the style of variant A can also be accepted by an automaton in the
                    style of variant B and vice versa. Most textbooks that cover pushdown
                    automata give specific examples of this process and how it can work.</p>
                <p>Generally, the proof is done by showing that for any PDA of variant 1,
                    we can construct a PDA in variant 2 that accepts the same language;
                    then doing the same thing in reverse, showing that we can construct a
                    PDA in variant 1 based on the PDA in variant 2.</p>
                <p>Oftentimes, creating the constructed PDAs in a new variant is the easy
                    part, but proving that the two PDAs actually accept the same language
                    is the hard part.</p>
                <p><strong>Which books have you been referencing to learn about PDAs:</strong></p>
                <p>There have been many, but these are a few I like:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser: This is
                        the canonical undergrad book on the theory of computation and
                        automata. The book&#39;s writing style is approachable, and the pacing
                        is very reasonable. The book&#39;s coverage of pushdown automata
                        specifically is not as complete as some other books in this list,
                        but this is a fantastic starting point if this topic matter is new
                        to you.</li>
                    <li>Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation by John
                        Hopcroft: This is my go to reference for information on automata and
                        computer science theory. I would say the book assumes slightly more
                        mathematical maturity than the Sipser book, but not by much. I find
                        that the proofs specifically in this book are laid out in a
                        particularly lucid way.</li>
                    <li>The Theory of Parsing, Translation, and Compiling by Alfred Aho and
                        Jeffrey D. Ullman</li>
