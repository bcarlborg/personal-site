                <p><em>This is only a short blurb about the project. I wrote more about the specifics of the implementation on the project&#39;s github <a href="https://github.com/bcarlborg/snake-game-in-riscv-assembly">üëâhereüëà</a></em></p>
                <p>I built a version of the classic snake game in RISC-V assembly! The program runs on qemu&#39;s emulated RISC-V <a href="https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/riscv/virt.html">virt computer platform</a>. The program is written at an embedded level. This means that there is no operating system running to support the program. The game software is responsible for knowing the system&#39;s memory map, communicating directly with devices, managing interrupts, and more!</p>
                <p>(Some people might reasonably take issue with this definition of &quot;embedded&quot; considering that the virt platform is a system that can only be run in an emulated environment... but these are just the terms we are going to roll with.)</p>
                <p>I was interested in this project because I wanted to learn more about how software interfaces directly with the computer system it runs on. This project was a great way to dip my toes into this lower-level of software development. I will definitely be taking on similar side projects in the future, this one was a lot of fun!</p>
