                <h2 id="the-project">The Project</h2>
                <p>I built a version of the classic snake game in RISC-V assembly! This is a project I have been chipping away at since the beginning of the year, and now that it is wrapped up, I am super excited to share it!</p>
                <p>The project runs on qemu&#39;s emulated RISC-V <a href="https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/riscv/virt.html">virt computer platform</a>. The game is written at an embedded level. This means that there is no operating system running to support the program. The game software is responsible for knowing the system&#39;s memory map, communicating directly with devices, managing interrupts, and more!</p>
                <p>(Some people might, reasonably, take issue with this definition of &quot;embedded&quot; considering that the virt platform is a system that can only be run in an emulated environment... but these are just the terms we are going to roll with.)</p>

                <h2 id="why-do-this-project">Why do this project?</h2>
                <p>I started this project because I wanted to get familiar with writing software that interacts directly with a computer system. Usually, in software development, we rely on the operating system to manage and abstract away the hardware that our code is running on. I wanted to peel away some of those layers and learn how to create a program that can directly utilize the underlying system.</p>
                <p>TODO(expand section)
                    write about being interested in learning how interrupts and devices work in more depth. Interrupts are a very different program flow. Wanting to which devices were involved with the regular operation of the cpu.</p>
                <p>TODO: wanting to learn more about qemu.</p>
                <p>TODO: learning the target for a compiler.</p>
                <h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
                <p>This project was a great way to dip my toes into this lower-level of software development and I learned a lot while making it. I&#39;ll list some of the learnings that have stuck with me most from the project:</p>

                <p>TODO(flesh out this section):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Writing all of the code for the game came relatively quickly after I decided how to architect it. Setting up the foundation for the development.</li>
                    <li>Learning how everything fits together was hard.</li>
                    <li>Starting with a truly blank canvas was hard</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="assembly-language-is-repetitive">Assembly language is repetitive.</h3>
                <p>TODO(flesh out this section):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>writing the same function prologue and epilogue over and over was a chore.</li>
                    <li>I think I could have enjoyed the process a lot more by investing in some simple tooling.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>TODO(flesh out this section):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>mostly used the stack</li>
                    <li>only needed a few small statically allocated chunks of memory.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>I was so focused on getting things working... I wish I had taken the time to get simple error reporting working sooner.</li>
