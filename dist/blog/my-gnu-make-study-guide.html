                <p>I have a love hate relationship with make.</p>
                <p>On one hand, It is one of my favorite tools. I can confidently rely on it because I know the vast majority of distros are likely to have it, meaning, wherever I am working, it will probably be accessible to me. When it is setup well, the interface for invoking make is just simple.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, writing makefiles has been tripping me up since day one. At first, the language and syntax of makefiles seems simple and austere, but the more you learn, the more you realize how many dark nooks and sharp edges are in the details. Every time I come back to writing makefiles, I feel like I have to relearn all sorts of oddities to get comfortable again.</p>
                <p>I created this “study guide” in an attempt to really solidify my understanding of the core knowledge you need to write makefiles. My hope is that through the process of writing these notes, I will have familiarized myself enough with the tool to avoid being so flustered the next time I come back to using the tool.</p>
                <p>I hope others get some value out of this post... But I mainly created this to help myself solidify some concepts — that is why I am calling this post a study guide.</p>
                <p><em>For someone interested in learning make well, I would recommend (the surprisingly well written) make documentation!</em></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Build systems are able to plan and execute a build of your project faster than a naive script by using information about the structure of your project.</li>
                    <li>Build systems use an internal model of your project’s build dependency graph.<ul>

                    </li>
                    <li>Build systems have different mechanisms for deriving your project’s build dependency graph.<ul>
                            <li>Some build systems (like make) require the programmer to elaborate and specify the project’s build dependency graph.</li>
                            <li>Other’s automatically derive the build dependency graph of your project based on the contents of your source files.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>Build systems use this dependency graph to implement two features that can make your builds run faster. <em>Incremental Builds</em> and <em>Parallel Builds.</em>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In an incremental build, results from from previous builds are used in the current build.<ul>
                                    <li>Effectively, intermediate build results are cached for use in future builds.</li>
                                    <li>The build system you use is responsible for figuring out which cached build artifacts are stale and need to be reconstructed for the current build</li>
                                    <li>Make is an incremental build system by default.</li>

                            <li>In a parallel build, multiple build tasks of the build process are run at the same time.<ul>
                                    <li>Builds typically involve many steps, many of which are independent from each other and can be run concurrently.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Makefile encodes each dependency in their build system with a rule.</li>
                    <li>Makefiles are an example of declarative code, they specify all of the dependencies in your project and how to build each dependency rather than specifying how to execute the build step by step (like you would in an imperative language )</li>
                    <li>Each rule has a targets (the outputs), zero or many prerequisites (the dependencies), and a recipe (the code for the build task). The basic syntax of a rule is as follows:</li>
                </ul>
                <pre><code>target: prerequisite1 prerequisite2 ...
  recipe-line-1
  recipe-line-2
  ...
</code></pre>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple rules describe a single node in the build dependency graph. More general rules can be written to describe many different parts of the dependency graph.</li>
                    <li>Makefiles also support a number of other programming constructs like variables, functions, pattern matching and shell globbing, but it is useful to remember that these constructs only exist to help you write better rules.</li>
                    <li>To run make, you specify the target (or targets) you would like make to build, and make will consult the rules in your makefile to determine which recipes to run.<ul>
