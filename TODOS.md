# Todos

_a very loose list of todos that I keep for this project. These todos are relevant for code behind the site, not the content of the site itself_

## Up Next

- [ ] figure out how to generate html for an article from markdown of a file
- [ ] figure out how to get images out of a google doc more trivially
  - [ ] need to get both images and html at the same time
- [ ] update styling (make it simpler and more plain)
- [ ] create home page
