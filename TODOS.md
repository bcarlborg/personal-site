# TODOs
_a very loose list of TODOs that I keep for this project. These TODOs are relevant for code behind the site, not the content of the site itself_

TODOs
- [ ] add a readme
- [ ] investigate if this project should be "type": "module" or not in the package.json
- [ ] some sort of contact form?
- [ ] a nicer footer? (including rss link?)
- [ ] Section for links to content other than my own (quotes, songs, other articles etc)
- [ ] move vscode config to git ignore
- [ ] build system for my sanity
  - [x] create a json metadata file that has all the info about the post
  - [x] parse the h2 headings and put those into the content
  - [x] move all <head> content into the generator
  - [ ] generalize the code to work on a directory of articles
  - [ ] support images and other assets in the directory
  - [ ] add navigator to the generator
  - [ ] construct rss in the generator
  - [ ] write documentation about the article processing code
  - [ ] cleanup the ugly ass code in this file
