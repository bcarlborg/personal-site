# My Personal Website
This is the github repository containing the content and build tools for my personal website at [beau-carlborg.com](https://www.beau-carlborg.com).

## Structure of this Repository
The content for my personal website is kept in the [src/](./src/) directory. This content is mostly written in markdown.

The HTML, CSS and assets that are served on my domain are kept in the [dist/](./dist/) directory.

The build scripts in [build-scripts/](./build-scripts/) create the content in the [dist/](./dist/) directory from the content in the `src/` directory.
