# My Personal Website
This is the github repository containing the content and build tools for my [personal website](beaucarlborg.com).

## Structure of this repository
The code that is served at my domain is contained in the `dist/` directory. The directory is automatically picked up
and served in its entirety at [beaucarlborg.com](beaucarlborg.com).

Most of the content on that website is in blog posts. The content for those posts is in the `src/` directory of this
respository. To construct the final HTML that is served on the website, I run scripts contained in the `build/` directory.

More specific information about the repository and the associated scripts can be found in the `DEVELOPER.md` file.
