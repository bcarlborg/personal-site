# My Personal Website

This is the github repository containing the content and build tools for my personal website at [beau-carlborg.com](https://www.beau-carlborg.com).

The content on the website is served by cloudflare. Cloudflare is configured to pickup the [dist/](./dist/) directory of this repository each time new content is pushed.

The content in the [dist/](./dist/) directory is generated by the scrappy/homebrew/crappy static site generator I've implemented in this repository. [DEVELOPER.md](./DEVELOPER.md) has a bit of information about how the build system works... but the content in that file is mostly just notes that I use to remember how to build the site.

Generally though, the content for the website lives in the [src/](./src/) directory and the scripts in the [build-scripts/](./build-scripts/) directory transform that content into the final website source code.
