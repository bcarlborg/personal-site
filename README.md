# My Personal Website
This is the github repository containing the content and build tools for my personal website at [beau-carlborg.com](https://www.beau-carlborg.com).

The content on the website is served by cloudflare. Cloudflare is configured to pickup the `dist/` directory of this repository each time new content is pushed.

The content in the `dist/` directory is generated by the "scrappy" / "homebrew" / "crappy" static site generator I've implemented in this repository. The [developer readme](./DEVELOPER.md) has a bit of information about how the build system works... but the content in that file is mostly just notes that I use to remember how to build the site.

Generally though, the content for the website lives in the [src directory](./src/) and the scripts in the [build-scripts directory](./build-scripts/) transform that content into the final website source code.
